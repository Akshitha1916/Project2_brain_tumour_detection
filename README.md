# Project2_brain_tumour_detection
## Building a brain tumour detection model using a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow & Keras. Used a brain MRI images data found on Kaggle. There are numerous analysed mri scans indicating types of positive and negative tumour scans. On these MRI scans, transfer learning can be used to extract the necessary features for classification. Alternately, you can start from scratch and train your own convolution neural network to recognise brain tumours.
